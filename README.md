# Discord-Interactions-JS
A simple way to interact and manage discord slash-commands.

# Credits
This module has been forked to be adapted to the scripts of the Tiny Pudding Server repositories.
The first version was made by https://github.com/MatteZ02/discord-interactions.

# Usage
You need to choose whether to type a Bot Token or a User Token.
```js
const interactions = require("@tinypudding/discord-slash-commands");

const client = new interactions.Client({
    bot_token: "you unique bot token",
    client_id: "your bots user id",
    user_token: "you unique user token"
});
```

## List all your existing commands.
```js
client.getCommands().then(console.log).catch(console.error);
```

## Will create a new command and log its data. If a command with this name already exist will that be overwritten.
```js
client
  .createCommand({
    name: "unique command name",
    description: "description for this unique command",
  })
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

## Will edit the details of a command.
```js
client
  .editCommand(
    { name: "new command name", description: "new command description" },
    "id of the command you wish to edit"
  )
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

## will delete a command
```js
client
  .deleteCommand("id of the command you wish to delete")
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

# API

Passing a guildID is optional. Doing so will make the command only be available on that guild.
Guild commands update **instantly**. We recommend you use guild commands for quick testing, and global commands when they're ready for public use.
